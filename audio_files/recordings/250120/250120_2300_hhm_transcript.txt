[00:00] Speaker 1: All right, so welcome to the SSM meeting, and this is a test, and we really just. Want to see if anybody's listening. If anybody's not listening.
[00:00] Speaker 1: And the biggest thing about all of this is that we're supposed to be testing some new UI thing and I don't see the UI changes.
[00:00] Speaker 1: So now I'm just testing it out, see if it's still recording. I love this thing. I can't even lie to you.
[00:00] Speaker 1: Once the board, it beats it pretty handily, actually. So let's see what the deep seat blog post says and break it down. So first performance on par with open AI one. So that means if we continue the prediction that open source is going to be about three to six. Months behind the closed source models. We should see an three level model within the next three.
[00:00] Speaker 1: Months. It is fully open source and they provide the white paper for it, and it is MIT. Licensed, distill and commercialize freely. Do anything you want with it. It is commercially viable. And you could use it for free at chat deepseek.com. Now, I already ran a test on it. I'll get to that in a moment, so stay tuned for that. And they've already released distill.
[00:00] Speaker 1: Distilled versions of it, so distilled from deepseac r one six small models fully open sourced. If we click into this, we can see distilled from deepseek. R one to still coin 1.5 714 and 32 b and r one distilled llama AP and 70 b. These perform incredibly well.
[00:00] Speaker 1: Look at the performance GBT 40 versus the distilled version with Llama 70 B. 70 versus 9.3 on the aim benchmark. Look at the live code bench score. Pretty. Much dominating the other non thinking models, I guess, obviously. But even the one mini model, really? Really. Good, but still the one mini do.
[00:00] Speaker 1: Dominates with the code forces competition, although with a 1600 score still. All right, so I was really testing that out, see if it was recording, and it looks like it was.
