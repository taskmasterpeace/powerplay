[00:00] Speaker 1: All right, so now that the meeting is started, I just want to go ahead and do a quick review to make sure that this thing is actually functioning the way that I want it to. Function because I'm not really sure that it's actually doing that. It's. Been over 10 seconds now. I still haven't seen nothing on the screen. What the.
[00:00] Speaker 1: Hell is happening?
[00:00] Speaker 1: Okay, so, yeah, it is happening.
[00:00] Speaker 1: So it is happening. I don't know.
[00:00] Speaker 1: So now that the first thing is appearing on screen, even though that was kind of odd, we're just going to keep it moving and we don't know if it's. Actually recorded in the file. We don't know if we can get it off of this. So we should have that at 56 seconds. I think that's what it should be.
[00:00] Speaker 1: So we're just going to keep talking and see how it goes.
[00:00] Speaker 1: Okay, so it came at 47.
[00:00] Speaker 1: This is freaking toy. No, it came at ten, actually. I don't know. So we're. Just going to keep it moving.
[00:00] Speaker 1: Yeah.
[00:00] Speaker 1: I can't believe.
[00:00] Speaker 1: How fucking dope this is.
[00:00] Speaker 1: It's going to send the chunk for the chunks.
